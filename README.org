  This tool is to ship QA/dev configs from the k8s cluster to your
  laptop or a testing container.  It should *not* run in the production
  cluster, or should at least not have ingress if it does.

** Usage
*** Copying to local disk
Place all configmaps and secrets in the current directory in the folders
~./configs~ and ~./secrets~, respectively.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
sh -c "$(curl -fsS http://tuttle/sh)" 
#+END_SRC

Place all configmaps and secrets in the directories ~/etc/configs~ and
~/etc/secrets~, respectively.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
sh -c "$(curl -fsS http://tuttle/sh\?prefix\=/etc)"
#+END_SRC
